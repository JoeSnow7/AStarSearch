    "In the table above we can see the results of running our code using both the \"Misplaced Tiles\" and the \"Manhattan Distance\" heuristics. Every row is a different initial state from which we start our search towards the goal. Both heuristics show you get the same amount of steps. This is most likely because they both have reached optimal solutions and it can't be reached in less time than that.\n",

    "However, we can see there's a big difference in their \"Maximum Frontier Size\" and \"Expansions\" columns. The \"Manhattan Distance\" heuristic seems to be much better as it doesn't have to expand as many nodes as the \"Misplaced Tiles\" heuristic. It is probably due to this that the maximum frontier size is also larger when we use the \"Misplaced Tiles\" heuristic.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Using the \"Manhattan Distance\" heuristic we probably expand much fewer nodes as it is a better heuristic for evaluating how close we are to reaching a solution. While the \"Misplaced Tiles\" heuristic can only return 9 values, there are many more states with the highest values as there are many ways to place all the tiles in the wrong position. The \"Manhattan Distance\" heuristic is more subtle in telling how far from the solution you are as it takes into account not only how many tiles are misplaced but how far they are from where they should be. Therefore, with this heuristic it is easier to have the next state be \"closer\" than it is with just counting misplaced tiles.\n",
